This module lets you get question and prediction information from Metaculus
and submit predictions, via the API (https://www.metaculus.com/api2/)

**Example**

In this example, we submit our own prediction based on the community prediction.

.. doctest::

    >>> import ergo
    >>> metaculus = ergo.Metaculus(username="oughtpublic", password="123456", api_domain="www")

    the question:
    https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3622/what-will-the-harvard-admit-rate-be-for-the-undergraduate-class-of-2029/
